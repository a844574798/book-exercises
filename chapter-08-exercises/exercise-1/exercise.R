# Exercise 1: creating and accessing lists

# Create a vector `my_breakfast` of everything you ate for breakfast
my_breakfast <- c("noodle", "eggs")

# Create a vector `my_lunch` of everything you ate (or will eat) for lunch
my_lunch <- c("curry", "vegetables")

# Create a list `meals` that has contains your breakfast and lunch
meals <- list(breakfast = my_breakfast,lunch = my_lunch)


# Add a "dinner" element to your `meals` list that has what you plan to eat 
# for dinner
meals$dinner <- c("rice", "pork")
print(meals)

# Use dollar notation to extract your `dinner` element from your list
# and save it in a vector called 'dinner'
dinner <- meals$dinner
print(dinner)

# Use double-bracket notation to extract your `lunch` element from your list
# and save it in your list as the element at index 5 (no reason beyond practice)
meals[[5]] <- meals[["lunch"]]
print(meals)

# Use single-bracket notation to extract your breakfast and lunch from your list
# and save them to a list called `early_meals`
early_meals <- meals[c("breakfast", "lunch")]  
print(early_meals)

### Challenge ###

# Create a list that has the number of items you ate for each meal
# Hint: use the `lappy()` function to apply the `length()` function to each item
num_of_meals <- lapply(meals,length)
print(num_of_meals)

# Write a function `add_pizza` that adds pizza to a given meal vector, and
# returns the pizza-fied vector
add_pizza <- function(meal_vector){
  new_vector <- c(meal_vector, "pizza")
  return(new_vector)
}

# Create a vector `better_meals` that is all your meals, but with pizza!
better_meals <- lapply(meals, add_pizza)
print(better_meals)
